PokeClicker modded

This is my personal version of the Pokemon Clicker game created by Ishadijcks, which can be played here - Ishadijcks.github.io - and found here - https://github.com/Ishadijcks/Ishadijcks.github.io.

Current differences include:
 - Shiny rate from breeding pokemon change from 1024 to 100
 - "Wrong site" notification removed
